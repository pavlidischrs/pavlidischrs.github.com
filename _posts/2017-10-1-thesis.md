#### Implementation of Estimation Algorithms in Wireless Sensor Networks
 
<br />
In my thesis I analysed the performance of a **Wireless Sensor Network (WSN)** in terms of power consumption. 
I emphasised in the number of the bits used in the signal quantisation (from analog to digital) at the nodes.

I applied **Stochastic Techniques** to a WSN system model to create an **optimisation problem**.
The object function was the total network's power consumption and it was subject to constrains, which derived from the **Weighted Least Square Estimator**.
I ended up in a **Mixed Nonlinear Integer** problem which I solved with the [OPTI Toolbox](https://www.inverseproblem.co.nz/OPTI/) in Matlab.
