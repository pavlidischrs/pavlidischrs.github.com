## Intro

This application would be a software for **musicological exercises**.

The exercise **scenario** is to display Sequences of Musical Notes with some gaps among the Notes. Then, the user is asked to fill the missing Symbols according to the musicological rules.

* The demo is displayed with OpenCV and the future goal is to add a GUI.

* The rules for the musical notes and the images have been chosen randomly!
